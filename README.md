1. Introduction
The objective of this assignment is to create a real-time face tracking system that detects and tracks faces within a video stream. This document outlines the research, implementation steps, testing procedures, and final deliverables.
2. Research and Exploration
Libraries and Models
Identified Libraries:
YOLO (You Only Look Once): Fast and accurate object detection.
Mediapipe: Provides high-fidelity solutions for face and hand tracking module developed by Google.
OpenCV: Widely used for computer vision tasks.
GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks): Advanced models for generating realistic images.
Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy: The precision of face detection.
Speed: The latency of the system.
Ease of Integration: Simplicity in incorporating the library into the system.
After evaluating the libraries, Mediapipe was chosen for its balance of accuracy, speed, and ease of integration.
